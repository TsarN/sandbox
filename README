Sandbox provides means to sandbox untrusted applications,
limit time and memory usage, detect runtime errors
and is primarily meant to be used in programming contests.
It targets Linux and Windows operating systems.

On Linux, it depends on libseccomp library, which you can find here: https://github.com/seccomp/libseccomp
You will need Linux kernel >= 3.5 to use it.

On Windows, it depends on PSAPI

Please note, that currently, Windows version is not considered
secure enough to be used in untrusted environment.
Linux version is safer, but there are no guarantees it will
work as intended either. Use at your own risk.
